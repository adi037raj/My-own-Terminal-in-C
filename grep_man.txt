GREP(1)                          User Commands                         GREP(1)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  for  PATTERNS  in  each  FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more
       patterns separated by newline characters, and  grep  prints  each  line
       that  matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep
       is used in a shell command.

       A FILE of “-”  stands  for  standard  input.   If  no  FILE  is  given,
       recursive  searches  examine  the  working  directory, and nonrecursive
       searches read standard input.

       In addition, the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are  the  same
       as  grep -E,  grep -F,  and  grep -r, respectively.  These variants are
       deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.

OPTIONS

      -i, --ignore-case
                Ignore  case  distinctions  in  patterns and input data, so that
              characters that differ only in case match each other.
              
      -c, --count
              Suppress  normal output; instead print a count of matching lines
              for each input file.  
              
      -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
    
              
      -l, --files-with-matches
              Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of  each  input
              file  from  which  output would normally have been printed.  The
              scanning will stop on the first match.
